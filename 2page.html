<h2 style="color:white">Independence</h2>     
<br>   
        <p1 style="color:white"> India is a very recent country, acieving independece only in 1947. It was part of the British government in a brutal colonial administration called the British Raj. WHen they recieved freedom, the British said that the Raj would be divded into two nations. One for the Muslim populace, and one for the majority Hindu. THe modern countries of Pakistan and Bangladesh were for the muslim populace, orignally being named East and West Pakistan. India was a nation for the Hindus. 1 year after independence, Pakistan invaded a country to the north of both India and Pakistan. It was called Kashmir. India was asked to intervene on behalf of the King of Kashmir. Pakistan invaded on behalf of the majority Muslim populace in Kashmir. This is the reason for the modern day Kashmir crisis.</p1>

        <h2 style="color:white">The Cold War</h2> 
        <p1 style="color:white">Soon after India found itself a country in poverty While in poverty, India was a beautiful country. Itt remained neutral in the cold war, but conditions pushed it to align with the Soviet Union. In the 60s, China, at the time led by Mao Zedong, invaded India. India lost the war, and lost even more territory in Kahmir etc. After this failure, India researched the reason for their failures, and they found out one reason was the weak air force. Following this India built up a strong and modern military and air force with Soviet equipment. They beat Pakistan in yet another war, freeing Bangladesh.</p1>

<h2 style="color:white">Post-Soviet Collapse</h2> 
        <p1 style="color:white">After the Soviet Union collapsed, India was left diplomatically isolated. When India tested a nuclear weapon, Bill Clinton of the United States imposed sanctions on India. He said that while India has a nuke, sanctions will prevent them from getting the materials and tech for missiles. Regardless, Indian scientist and later President, APJ Abdul Kalam built India a missile, and resulted in sanctions being removed.</p1>

<h2 style="color:white">A New Millenium</h2> 
        <p1 style="color:white">As the world advanced into the 2000s, India was skyrocketed to the top. A boom in technology such as software development resulted in amazing economic growth for India. Millions of Indians went abroad and India was finally lifted from poverty. India soon became a military superpower, and was even able to resist China. Today India has one of the most advanced space programs in the world, along with economies and army. </p1>
